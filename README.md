# ExpenseTracker
A simple program to track and save expenses.

This is a basic Java program I wrote during the summer of 2024 to reinforce my understanding of concepts learned in class. In this project, I used File I/O to read from and write to a file. I understand that this is not the industry-standard approach for storing and retrieving data. However, the primary goal of this project was to stay engaged and practice what I learned. Additionally, I aimed to create a small, manageable project that would encourage problem-solving and logical thinking.
